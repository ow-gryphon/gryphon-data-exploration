# Gryphon data exploration
*(gryphon-data-exploration)*

Provides a range of methods for exploring and visualizing a dataset. This includes capability to look across the dataset as well as to investigate individual variables (numerical, categorical) fields in-depth. This does not provide time-aware exploration capabilities, as those are in another package.
